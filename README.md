# Ethereum-Donator
This dapp functions as an Ethereum Donator. After a user submits a donation request, other users can view the request and donate ether. All can see current donation details from the client application. Receivers can choose to receive all donations stored in the smart contract. Once a donation is received, a flag is set to notify the client. The received amount is stored in the smart contract and viewable by the client. The smart contract is terminated after donations are received.
