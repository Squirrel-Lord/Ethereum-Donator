# Ethereum-Donator
This dapp functions as an Ethereum Donator. After a user submits a donation request, other users can donate ether and view current donation details from the client application. The receiver of the donations may not donate to the smart contract. However, receivers can choose to receive donations stored in the smart contract or set a new receiving address. The received amount is stored in the smart contract and viewable by the client. The smart contract becomes inactive after donations are received.
